                            <h4>&lt; HTML 5 and CSS Website &sol;&gt;</h4>
                            <p>This project was my first real dive into creating something cool with HTML 5 and CSS. It taught me how to read a design comp using Photoshop and how to take that information and replicate it into a website.
                              <br><br> What I loved about this project was seeing how HTML and CSS work together. They work brilliantly in tandem to produce something amazing. It was a lot of fun to experiment and see a design concept come to life in a fully functioning website.</p>

                            <h4>&lt; HTML 5 and CSS Website &sol;&gt;</h4>
                            <p>My first complete solo project. Similar to the Jubilee Austen Project, I used a design comp to write up a website using HTML and CSS. This project required me to rely more heavily on the knowledge I had learned previously.
                              <br><br>This design was full of challenges and really forced me to go beyond my current scope of knowledge and seek out answers for many of the questions I had. It was definitely a fun learning experience and I&apos;m excited to do more of them in the future.</p>

                           <p>Challenges upon challenges! <br><br> This project is another recreation I made from a design comp. I chose this one because I really enjoy the restaurant look and knew it wasn&apos;t a simple write up.
                             I wanted to try something that was a bit more complex than any of my previous work and get out of my comfort zone. I&apos;m pleased with how it came out!

              <p>Name&apos;s Chelsey!
                <br><br> I&apos;m relatively new to the design and development space and I&apos;m eager to explore all it has to offer!
                <br><br> I currently work as a Pharmacy Technician, and while I like it, I&apos;ve been wanting to branch out for awhile. I got swept away by my fascination with Web Development and programming and I came across Skillcrush. I figured this might be what I&apos;ve been looking for, so I decided to take the plunge.
                <br><br> Python and Front-End Development have also caught my eye and I&apos;m excited to dive deeper into them.
                <br><br>I also have a cat named Coconut and she&apos;s a big goofball. She&apos;s a big inspiration for me.
                <br><br>Can&apos;t wait to work with you!</p>
